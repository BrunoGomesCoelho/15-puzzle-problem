Naive and A* implementation of the classic [15-puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle) in python. Done as part of the Advanced Algorithms class, fall 2017.

Just git clone then unzip. 

# Usage

Make sure you have python version 3.4 or higer. Then just run the version you want: "python3 naive" or "python3 a_star"

If you do not want to check beforehand if there is a answer to the puzzle, use "no_check=true" after the command, for example "python3 a_star no_check=true".

# Project stucture

This project implements things such as continuos integration through [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/) and code quality through [Codacy](www.codacy.com). As part of CI, test cases have been created for all the major input possibilities and can be viewed in the `test.py` file.
